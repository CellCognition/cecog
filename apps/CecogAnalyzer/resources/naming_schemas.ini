# generated by the GerlichLab MetaMorph journals:

# this information might be present

# in ALL cases only direct subdirectories (one level down) following this regex
# are considered. empty string allows all. 
# here directories with leading underscore are ignored
# for all regular expressions the SEARCH method is used (not MATCH)
