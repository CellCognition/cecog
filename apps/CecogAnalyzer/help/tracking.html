<h1>Tracking</h1>

The distance for nearest-neighborhood tracking, class transition motifs and class filters can be defined. Tracking and motif selection can be tested independently for reasons of performance. Lines between connected objects fading out over time visualize tracking. Tracks containing the defined motif, e.g. transition from pro- to prometaphase, are truncated to the same length and exported into one file per event.
