# The number of classes in the classification
# per single time point.
numberOfClasses

# The number of hidden classes may be larger or smaller than
# the original number of classes in the classification. If
# the number of hidden states is smaller, than all classes
# without an in-node in the hiddenNodeAssociation are ignored.
# One can copy some of the original classes by assigning
# multiple hidden states to the same original class.
numberOfHiddenStates

# These are the classes allowed at the first time point of the time series.
startNodes

# All nodes before the -> are linked to all nodes after
# the ->. This graph represent all allowed transitions.
# All other transition probabilities are set to 0.
transitionGraph

# assign each hidden class the corresponding class of the original classification
# allows to copy single classes. These associations are used as initial
# assignments. The class name of the original class is transferred.
# This is a n-to-1 association
