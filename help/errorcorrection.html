    <h1>Error Correction</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Trajectories of class labels may contain a number of
      misclassified observations. The misclassifications appear as
      noise which can be smoothed with help of <img class="extlink"
      src=":extlink"/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">hidden
      Markov models</a> (HMM). The HMM learns its parameters from the
      tracks of one experimental condition
      i.e <i>position</i>, <i>Oligo-Id</i> or <i>Gene Symbol</i>
      separately. Besides the smoothing model, one
      can <a href="#constrain_graph">apply</a> additional biological
      constraints to the HMM to model (e.g. mitotic progression) or
      prohibit a transition from one state (e.g. apoptotic) to any other
      state.<br/><br/>
      It is important to note that the error correction depends <b>not</b> on
      the method of the event selection (supervised and
      unsupervised).
      The difference lies in the HMM learning
      algorithm. Supervised event selection (from support vector machine)
      works with both <i>Smoothing Model</i> and
      <i><img class="extlink"src=":extlink"/>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm">
        Baum-Welch algorithm</a></i>. Unsupervised event
      selection (TC3) works only with <i>Baum-Welch</i>, since it does
      not provide accurate prediction probabilities.
      <br><br>
      The error correction saves the output in a sub-folder <tt>analysis/hmm</tt>.
    </p>
    The association between individual movies i.e. <i>positions</i>
    and experimental information such as <i>Oligo-Id</i> or the name
    of the targeted <i>Gene Symbol</i> can be defined in a
    simple <a href="#position_labels">text file</a>.

    <h3>Note</h3>
    To apply the error correction on time-lapse movies one has to
    enable hdf5 output in section <a href="qrc:/output">Output</a>. Events output has 
    to be enables. Also, if the generation of gallery images is required, the raw
    data has to be included in the hdf5 output.

    <h3>HMM learning algorithm</h3>
    <a name="hmm_learning">
      <h4>HMM learning algorithm</h4>
      <p class="text"><i>Smoothing model</i> learns the HMM parameters by
        counting the conditional prediction probabilities.
        No Baum-Welch estimation is performed afterwards.
        This method is a 1:1 replacement of the R-implementation
        (CecogAnalyzer &le; 1.4.x).<br/>
        <i>Baum-Welch</i> is the standard method to estimate HMM model
        parameters.
        <br><br>
        <i>Smoothing model</i> results in a robust smoothing by
        suppressing off-diagonal emissions (ad hoc assumption).
        Further it relies on confident prediction probabilities
        provided by the support vector machine. <i>Baum-Welch</i> is
        mandatory for unsupervised event selection, but works
        well in both cases.
      </p>
    </a>

    <a name="constrain_graph">
      <h4>Constrain graph</h4>
      <p class="text">To apply biological constraints to the HMM one
      has to provide a XML-file that contains information about the
      allowed transitions, emissions and start probabilities. Those
      files are automatically validated to avoid typing errors. An
      example file that works with the <img class="extlink"
      src=":extlink"/><a href="http://cellcognition.org/downloads/data">reference
      data</a>
        from the Cellcognition website can be
        found <a href="qrc:/hmm_constraints">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        The transition, emission and start probabilities of the HMM
        are learned from the raw data obtained from the event
        selection. A constraint file defines a mask that is
        applied to the model parameters to allow or
        disallow a specific transitions or emissions (0 or 1). If this option
        is omitted, all transitions, emissions and start values are
        allowed. This is equivalent to set all values in the
        constraint files to one. Each channel needs a separate
        constraint file, since the number of classes is not
        necessarily the same.

    <a name="position_labels">
      <a name="mappingfile">
        <h4>Position labels</h4>
        <p class="text">Provide a table that associates the
        experimental conditions to a position (<i>plate mapping</i>
        or <i>plate layout</i>). For now only <i>Oligo Id</i>
        and <i>Gene Symbol</i> are supported. To use this option one
        needs to provide a simple tab-separated text file with three
        columns: <tt>Position</tt> (must match the position
        names), <tt>Oligo-Id</tt> (any string), and <tt>Gene
        Symbol</tt> (any string).<br><br>
        Be aware of the fact that different positions can have the
        same <i>Oligo-Id</i> or <i>Gene Symbol</i>. That means
        tracks from more than one position can be grouped into the same
        plot. The table must list all positions and should
        not contain empty fields. It will produce an error, if positions 
        exist that are not listed in the plate mapping table.
