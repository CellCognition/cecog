<h1 id="CecogAnalyzerInstallationTips">CecogAnalyzer - Startup Help</h1>
<p>
The <a class="wiki" href="http://www.cellcognition.org/wiki/CecogAnalyzer">CecogAnalyzer</a> package comes with batteries included.
<br><br>
It contains

<ul><li>a small set of raw images (10 timepoints of H2b-aTubulin)
</li><li>the two classifiers for H2b and aTubulin to test classification
</li><li>a pre-configured settings file which is loaded on start-up.
</li></ul>

</p>
<p>
You can
</p>
<ul><li>test <strong>Object Detection</strong> of the <i>primary</i> (H2b) and <i>secondary</i> (aTubulin) channels
</li><li>retrain and test the classifier for H2b and aTubulin in <strong>Classification</strong>

</li><li>test the tracking and select events in <strong>Tracking</strong> (only few short tracks are found with the current settings within the 10 frames)
</li><li>for <strong>Error correction</strong> you need to install the <i>R-project</i> (see below)
</li></ul><h2 id="Packagedata">Package data</h2>
<p>
The package contains a sub-folder <strong>Data</strong> with

</p>
<ul><li><tt>Settings</tt>
<ul><li><tt>demo_settings.conf</tt>, the settings file which is loaded on startup
</li><li><tt>graph_primary.txt</tt>, an example for a graph definition file (H2b)
</li><li><tt>graph_secondary.txt</tt>, an example for a graph definition file (Tubulin)
</li><li><tt>position_labels.txt</tt>, position labels such as OligoID or GeneSymbol
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><tt>Classifier</tt>
<ul><li>the class definition and sample annotations to pick samples with the larger data set, feature and SVM models to test (or train) the H2b and aTubulin classifiers
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><tt>Images</tt>
<ul><li>the input folder of the raw images

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><tt>Analysis</tt>
<ul><li>the output folder where results are written to
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<strong>Note</strong><br />
With the included raw images picking of classifier samples is not
possible since not all necessary positions/timepoints are included.<br />
Please download the larger H2b-Tubulin data.
</p>
<h2 id="Motifselectionerrorcorrection">Motif selection &amp; error correction</h2>
<p>
With the included data and settings only few mitotic events with four frames duration will be selected.
</p>

<p>
To perform motif selection and error correction as presented in our paper more timepoints are needed than
the package contains. Larger data sets can be found online at <a class="wiki" href="http://www.cellcognition.org/wiki/Download">downloads</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also might want to increase the length of the selected tracks, especially after the pro-prometa onset. Increase therefore the values in <strong>Tracking</strong> -&gt; <strong>Timepoints [post]</strong> and <strong>Timepoints [pre]</strong>.
</p>

<h2 id="R-projectdependency">R-project dependency</h2>
<p>
Error correction requires the installation of the statistics project R.
See <a class="ext-link" href="http://r-project.org"><span class="icon"> </span>http://r-project.org</a>
</p>
<p>
The R-packages <strong>hwriter</strong>, <strong>igraph</strong> and <strong>Cairo</strong> are needed as well.
These packages can be installed via the R's <i>Package Installer</i> or by running
following commands from the R command line:

</p>
<pre class="wiki">install.packages('hwriter')
install.packages('igraph')
install.packages('Cairo')
</pre><p>
The R executable which needs to be specified is NOT the R-GUI and should be
found automatically for MacOSX and Windows. Otherwise try
</p>
<p>
MacOS:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/bin/R32
</pre><p>
or
</p>
<pre class="wiki">/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/bin/R
</pre><p>
Windows:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">C:\Program Files\R\R-2.10.0\bin\R.exe

</pre>
