    <h1>Tracking</h1>
    <p>
      To study temporal progression of cellular stages on the level of
      individual cells objects must be followed over time
      (called <i>tracking</i>). Tracking is achieved here by a
      relatively simple nearest-neighbor approach requiring a low cell
      movement or a reasonable short time-lapse.
      <br/>
      As demonstrated in our paper the selection of events (e.g. onset
      of mitosis) is often desired to enrich and <i>in silico</i>
      align the trajectories. This can be achieved by defining
      a <i>motif</i> of two consecutive class labels. The trajectories
      can be specified to be of equal length and furthermore corrected
      (see <a href="qrc:/errorcorrection">Error Correction</a>).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The distance for nearest-neighborhood tracking, class transition
      motifs and class filters can be defined. Tracking and motif
      selection can be tested independently for reasons of
      performance. Lines between connected objects fading out over
      time visualize tracking. Tracks containing the defined motif,
      e.g. transition from pro- to prometaphase, are truncated to the
      same length and exported into one file per event.

    <h3>Parameters</h3>

    <a name="region">
      <h4>Region name</h4>
      <p class="text">Segmentation region that is used for tracking. Currently only
        the &#34;<i>primary</i>&#34; region (of the primary channel) is
        supported.
      </p>
    </a>

    <a name="tracking"></a>
    <h4>Tracking</h4>
    <p class="text">Parameters for object tracking by nearest-neighborhood.
      <a name="tracking_maxobjectdistance">
        <h4 class="sub">Max. object x-y distance</h4>
        <p class="subtext">Maximal distance (pixels) between objects in
          two consecutive frames to be connected. This value scales
          directly with lens magnification.
        </p>
      </a>

      <a name="tracking_maxtrackinggap">
        <h4 class="sub">Max. time-point gap</h4>
        <p class="subtext">Maximal number of time-points (frames) to
          gap. Only relevant for out-of-focus or missing images in a
          movie.
        </p>
      </a>

      <a name="tracking_maxsplitobjects">
        <h4 class="sub">Max split events</h4>
        <p class="subtext">Maximal number of allowed trajectory
          splits. Only relevant if more than object is found in the
          neighborhood of the next frame. E.g. values of 2 or 3 take care
          of chromosome segregation but reduce complexity of the tracking
          graph.

<a name="tracking_visualization">
  <h4>Visualization</h4>
  <p class="text">Connections between objects in consecutive frames can be visualized by object centroids and lines between centroids.
    Normal connections are shown in <span style="background-color:
    #FFFF00; border: 1px solid black; font-weight:
    bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> yellow (1-1 connection) and
    trajectory splits in <span style="background-color: #00FFFF;
    border: 1px solid black; font-weight:
    bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> turquoise (1-N connection).

<a name="tracking_visualize_track_length">
  <h4 class="sub">Max. time-points</h4>
  <p class="subtext">Maximal number of time-points for which the
    connections are shown backwards. The value <tt>-1</tt> shows all
    connection till the beginning of the movie (increases computation
    time). The visualization is faded from the current time-point (0%
    transparency) backwards to the last time-point (100%
    transparency).
