<h1>Feature Extraction</h1>
Following segmentation, each object needs to be described by quantitative features that form the basis to distinguish them by a classifier 
algorithm. The performance of a the classification relies substantially on an appropriate collection of relevant features. CellCognition offers
the following groups of features. If no prior knowledge is available, it is recommended to use all features groups.
<hr></hr>
<a name="basicshape"><h3>Basic shape</h3>
<p class="text">Basic features are characterizing the shape of an object such as the circularity and the geometry.
</p>
</a>

<a name="intensity"><h3>Basic intensity features</h3>
<p class="text">Basic intensity features are simple statistics on the original gray value distribution of an object. 
In contrast to texture features basic intensity features cannot describe substructures and repeated subpatterns of the object.
</p>
</a>

<a name="haralick"><h3>Haralick features</h3>
<p class="text">Haralick fetaures characterize the texture of objects by means of the joint distribution of pixel value combinations. 
In histograms, one tries to analyse the frequency of certain gray level values in an image. The inconvenience of this representation 
is that the spatial distribution of thesevalues is completely lost. One method to address this is to record combinationsof pixel values 
at a certain distance. This can be done by the co-occurrence matrix depending on a distance d and an angle t. Haralick features consist of 
several statistic based on the pixel co-occurrences.

<a name="stat_geom"><h3>Statistical geometric features</h3>
<p class="text">Statistical geometric features (or Levelset features) are shape features for different levelsets (i.e. results of 
different thresholds) and, as such, texture features. For each of the following features, a distribution of values is calculated according 
to the set of thresholds. For each of these distributions, the maximal feature value, the average feature value, the sample mean and the 
sample standard deviation are calculated as statistics (max_value, avg_value, sample_mean, sample_sd). Furthermore, all features are 
calculated on the foreground and on the background after thresholding.
</p>
</a>

<a name="convhull"><h3>Convex hull features</h3>
<p class="text">The convex hull of an object X is the smallest convex set containing X. Important features can be derived 
from the convex hull. These feature help to find binuclear cell nuclei for instance. A perfect binuclear cell should have two 
concavities of more or less the same area. A trinuclear cell will have three concavities of similar size, if the three nuclei 
are positioned on the corners of a triangle. 
</p>
</a>

<a name="distance"><h3>Distance map features</h3>
<p class="text">Let D be the distance map of set X (binary image), i.e. D(x) is the distance of pixel x to the nearest pixel y in X. 
If the object corresponds to an ellipse, one can expect one prominent maximum in the distance function. If it could be decomposed 
into two overlapping ellipses, where each of these ellipses are well recognizable, on would expect two prominent maxima. Actually, 
if the basic shapes are sufficiently prominent, the number of prominent maxima should be the same as the number of the basic shapes.
</p>

<a name="granugrey"><h3>Granulometry features</h3>
<p class="text">Granulometry allows one to study the size distribution of objects in an image. For this, the image is 
successively simplified by operators which remove all (bright or dark) structures up to a certain size. A record is kept 
of how much is removed from the image with each filtering step, leading to a distribution of measurements, which can be 
seen as size dependent texture or shape descriptors. 
</p>
</a>

<a name="moments"><h3>Moments</h3>
<p class="text">Moments and derived features have been initially defined to characterize distributions of values (like histograms), 
but they can also be used as shape or texture descriptors.
