    <h1>General</h1>
    Defines directories for raw images <i>(Input directory)</i> and
    output <i>(Output directory)</i>. Channels, wells (positions) and time
    frames can be constrained here.
    <br/>
    Settings are saved to a *.conf file (simple text file).

    <h3 class="param">Parameters</h3>

    <a name="version">
      <h4>Cecog version</h4>
      <p class="text">CellCognition saves its version number to the settings
        file. The user gets a notification if the version numbers of
        CellCognition and the settings file do not match.</p>
    </a>

    <a name="pathin">
      <h4>Input directory</h4>
      <p class="text">Contains raw images as saved by the
        microscope. Cellcogition supports TIFF stacks (one image per
        file), structured similar to our demo data, which must have
        <ul>
          <li>one subdirectory per movie (referred to as "position"), and</li>
          <li>similar naming schema - named tokens in the filename).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="text">Multipage TIFFs are interpreted as z-stacks,
        but the corresponding token is then ignored. Images must have a
        bitdepth of 8 or 16 bit.
        (see <a href="qrc:/objectdetection#primary_channel_conversion">
          16 to 8 bit conversion in Object Detection</a>). LZW or ZIP
        compressed TIFFs are supported.
      </p>
    </a>

    <a name="has_multiple_plates"></a>
    <h4>Multiple plates</h4>
    <p class="text">The input data is organized on a
      per-plate-basis i.e. a <i>plate</i>-directory that contains
      subdirectories of the single wells. By default this option is
      unchecked and the input directory is the path to
      the <i>plate</i>-directory. If this option is checked, the
      input directory is a path to directory that contains
      multiple <i>plate</i>-directories.
    </p>

    <a name="pathout"></a>
    <h4>Output directory</h4>
    <p class="text">All results are saved in the <i>Output
        directory</i> except
      classifier annotation and training data.
      <br><br>
      Here's an example for the subdirectory structure is:

<p class="text">Short description:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>channel_gallery</tt> - single channel gallery
          images beside each other. Objects (cells) are sourrounded by color
          coded contours (color from class definition but white as
          default).</li>
        <li><tt>gallery</tt> - different kinds of gallery images</li>
        <li><tt>images</tt> - output directory for label-/,

    <br><br>
    Not all directories are described above. We refer to
    the <a href="http://cellh5.org">cellh5-format</a>. It contains the
    same information and any post-processing should be based on those files.
    </p>
</p>

<a name="namingscheme">
  <h4>Naming scheme</h4>
  <p class="text">Images must follow a naming scheme in order to be importable.
    So far, only image sequences with token in the filename are
    supported (see <a href="#pathin">input directory</a>).
    Schema definitions can be customized by adding a propper entry to
    the file <tt>naming_schemas.ini</tt>, located in
    the <tt>resources</tt> subdirectory of CecogAnalyzer.</p>
</a>

<a name="structure_file">
  <h4>Structure file location</h4>
  <p class="text">In order to map the input data to coordinates
  (channels, position, z and time), the input directory needs to be
    scanned in the first place. This process is time consuming but needs
    to be done only once. The scan result is saved in the so called
    "structure file" which is reused later on.<br></p>
</a>

<a name="constraints">
  <h3>Coordinate constraints</h3>
  <p class="text">In order to speed up processing, it is possible to
    constrain the dataset to certain channels, positions, frames, etc...<br>
  </p>
</a>

<a name="channels">
  <h4>Channels</h4>
  <p class="text">Restrict processing to the checked channels. The
    mapping between e.g. <i>primary</i> and <i>color</i> is setup
    in <a href="qrc:/objectdetection#primary_channelid">Object
      Detection</a>.
  </p>
</a>

<a name="constrain_positions">
  <h4>Positions</h4>
  <p class="text">Define a coma-separated list of positions to restrict
    processing.</p>
</a>

<a name="redofailedonly">
  <h4>Skip finished positions</h4>
  <p class="text">Already processed positions are skipped
    automatically. An empty file is created for every finished
    position in <tt>log/_finished/</tt>.
  </p>
</a>

<a name="framerange">
  <h4>Timelapse</h4>
  <p class="text">Define <tt>first</tt>-frame, <tt>last</tt>-frame and
    frame <tt>increment</tt>. Note that <tt>increment</tt> means each
    n<sup>th</sup> frame, independently of the time delta between two frames.

<a name="crop_image">
  <h4>Image cropping</h4>
  <p class="text">Define a sub-rectangle in the image for processing.</p>
