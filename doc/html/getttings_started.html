      The <a class="wiki"
             href="http://www.cellcognition.org/wiki/CecogAnalyzer">CecogAnalyzer</a>
      package comes with demo data (battery package) included.
      <br><br>
      It contains

      <ul><li>a small set of raw images (10 timepoints of H2b-aTubulin)
        </li><li>the two classifiers for H2b and aTubulin to test classification
        </li><li>a pre-configured settings file which is loaded on start-up.
      </li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>test <strong>Object Detection</strong> of the <i>primary</i>
        (H2b) and <i>secondary</i> (aTubulin) channels
      </li>
      <li>retrain and test the classifier for H2b and aTubulin in <strong>Classification</strong>
      </li>
      <li>test the tracking and select events
        in <strong>Tracking</strong> (only few short tracks
        are found with the current settings within the 10 frames)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Packagedata">Package data</h2>
    <p>
      The package contains a sub-folder <strong>Data</strong> with
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>Settings</tt>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <tt>demo_settings.conf</tt>, the settings file which is
            loaded on startup. All paths to directories and files
            contain the string <tt><i>$BATTERY_PACKAGE</i></tt>, which is
            replaced the by your local path where the demo data is installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>graph_primary.xml</tt>, an example for an hmm constraint file (H2b)
          </li>
          <li><tt>graph_secondary.xml</tt>, an example for an hmm constraint file (Tubulin)
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>position_labels.txt</tt>, position labels such as OligoID or GeneSymbol
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>Classifier</tt>
        <ul>
          <li>the class definition and sample annotations to pick samples with the larger data set, feature and SVM models to test (or train) the H2b and aTubulin classifiers
    </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><tt>Images</tt>
        <ul><li>the input folder of the raw images

    </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><tt>Analysis</tt>
        <ul><li>the output folder where results are written to
    </li></ul></li></ul><p>
      <strong>Note</strong><br />
      With the included raw images picking of classifier samples is not
      possible since not all necessary positions/timepoints are included.<br />
      Please download the larger H2b-Tubulin data.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Motifselectionerrorcorrection">Motif selection &amp; error correction</h2>
    <p>
      With the included data and settings only few mitotic events with four frames duration will be selected.
    </p>

    <p>
      To perform motif selection and error correction as presented in our paper more timepoints are needed than
      the package contains. Larger data sets can be found online at <a class="wiki" href="http://www.cellcognition.org/wiki/Download">downloads</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also might want to increase the length of the selected tracks, especially after the pro-prometa onset. Increase therefore the values in <strong>Tracking</strong> -&gt; <strong>Timepoints [post]</strong> and <strong>Timepoints [pre]</strong>.
