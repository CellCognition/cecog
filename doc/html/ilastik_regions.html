    <h2>Segmentation: Ilastik classifier</h2>

    <p class="text"><a href="http://ilastik.org/"></a>ilastik</a> is a simple, user-friendly tool for interactive image pixel classification. This plug-in implements a threshold based segmentation based on the output of the ilastik classifier.</p>
<h4>ilastik</h4>
<p  class="text">In order to use the plug-in you have to install ilastik 0.5 from source as well as CellCognition from source (note that the ilastik 0.5 python source has to be in your PYTHONPATH).
</p>
<p class="text">
  First, you have to export the learned ilastik classifier into into an hdf5 file (.h5): after you created an ilastik project and learned your classes of interest, you can export the classifier by clicking the "Export classifier" button.
</p>
<h4>Using this plug-in</h4>
<p class="text">
  This plugi-in is basically the same as the adaptive threshold plug-in. The difference is that, the threshold is not based on the raw data, but uses the probability maps as generated by the ilastik classifier.
</p>
<h4>Help</h4>
<p  class="text">
  This plug-in is still experimental. If you have any questions or problems regarding the ilastik CellProfiler module, please feel free to contact one of the CellCognition or ilastik developers!
