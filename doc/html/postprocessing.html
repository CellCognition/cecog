      <h2>IBB-Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The ratio between the of the secondary inside and outside
        region measured on the IBB marker is used to determine the
        Nuclear Envelope Break Down (NEBD) and the IBB-Onset. Together
        with cell cycle information from the primary channel
        (Chromatin) various timing measures are extracted, such as the timing
        from NEBD to the Separation event. For more information see:
